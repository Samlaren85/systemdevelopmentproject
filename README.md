This project was a part of my Bachelor of Science with a major in Informatics - specialisation Systems Development.
Me and my group developed this application as a part of a 7,5hp course in 10 weeks time.
The pilot study was simulated by our teachers and handed to us as a group assignment in textual format.
This then led to a series of interviews with "the customer" (one of our teachers) to specify the damands on the system.
We managed all the customer demand activities and created the requirements specification for the whole project.
This inturn was used to develop the code you see in this repository.

We earned ourself a top grade for this work and are extremly proud of that achivement.
